# **Weather Wiz**  
**Your AI-powered weather expert, trained on multi-station data to deliver precise and reliable forecasts.**

---

## **Overview**  
Weather Wiz is a cutting-edge machine learning project designed to predict weather patterns, specifically temperature and radiation, using 25 years of historical data collected from meteorological stations across Israel by the Israel Meteorological Service (IMS). The data was sampled every 10 minutes daily and later aggregated into a daily template. By leveraging advanced regression algorithms and AI techniques, this project delivers accurate and reliable weather forecasts, empowering users to make informed decisions.

## **Purpose**  
The main goal of this project is to harness the power of AI to analyze environmental data and provide precise weather predictions. Factors like maximum and minimum temperatures, cloud cover, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed are taken into account to train models for accurate forecasting.
